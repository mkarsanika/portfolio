# About Me

Hi there! Iâ€™m Sanika, a final-year Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for building meaningful solutions and making an impact through technology. 

I am naturally a curious person who loves solving real-world problems-whether it's about solving a challenge or figuring out the best way to do something smarter and faster. I enjoy to tackle those challenges by both logical thinking and creative ideas, and I get excited about AI, Automation and Tech that makes life easier. I was selected for AI-Retirethon at TIAA Company where our team had built an AI Based Allocation Engine for Retirement Investments where with the efficient teamwork skills, we developed a platform which will fetch real-time data of stocks and give allocation results to the customers. I was selected for the internship for the role DevOps and Apigee Developer at TSYS Global Payments where I did daily scrum calls and implemented Agile Methodology, gathered the requirements from clients, handled their queries and finally delivered a fully developed and successfully working proxy. Outside of work, I am a kind of person who loves watching movies, playing sports like Badminton, Table Tennis and Lawn Tennis. I enjoy communicating with all kinds of people-even making Introverts talk like Extroverts. I thrive in leadership roles, helping teams achieve success. Passionate about exploring new IT trends, I believe learning should never stop. ðŸš€
